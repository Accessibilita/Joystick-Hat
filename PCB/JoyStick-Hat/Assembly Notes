assmbely notes:
- Footprint for Raspberry Pi Header connector is wrong, its 42 pins should be 40
- 10uF caps on input = footprint too small!
- C19 footprint too big
- Max chip Pin 1 legend too hard to see
- RS485 diode orientation legend not on PCB
- STM32 Pin 1 legend not there
- Header holes for DCDC regulator modules too small had to hack them on there.
- ARM Cortex M Debug Connector issues, signals are flipped around, I suspect that the footprint numbering doesn't correspond to the symbol numbering.
